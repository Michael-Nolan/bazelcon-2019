# Oasis Digital "Building with Bazel" case studies / examples

## WARNING - this repository is arranged in a very unused way

Each of the numbered directories is intended as an example (a very
tiny example, from a Bazel point of view) of a complete workspace.
That's why many things are duplicated between them; they DO NOT
jointly compose one thing, each one stands completely alone.

Some learners keep wanting to mentally connect the examples to each
other. In a future version we might ship these as completely separate
repositories.
