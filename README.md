# Bazelcon 2019 "Bazel Boot Camp" case studies / examples

## This repository is arranged in a very unusual way

Each of the numbered directories is a separate, small example of a
complete Bazel workspace. That's why many things are duplicated
between them; they DO NOT jointly compose one thing, each stands
alone.
